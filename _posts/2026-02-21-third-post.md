title: "Mother and Father Falls"
---

Trafalgar Falls is called a twin falls of both mother and father, glowing gracefully.
There is actually a hidden hot spring at the base of "Father" Falls.

Finding your way up to the hot springs takes a lot of climbing on rocks and wading through the water.
Be prepared to spend at least 30 minutes making your way up.

Once you get close, look for the orange-stained rocks.
The hot spring water comes out of the rocks slightly to the left.

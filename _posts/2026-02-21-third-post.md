title: "Mother and Father Falls"

Trafalgar Falls is called a twin falls of both mother and father,glowing gracefully.They are more than two picturesque waterfalls — there’s actually a hidden hot spring at the base of “Father” falls!
Finding your way up to the hot springs takes a lot of maneuvering — climbing on rocks and wading through the water. Be prepared to spend at least 30 minutes making your way up to the top.

Once you get close, look for the orange-stained rocks! The hot spring water comes out of the rocks slightly to the left of the falls.
